	<p><b>Autonomous Vehicle Project</b></p>
	<p>Four other team members and I were given a project by our advisor Leland Harker to create an autonomous car to enter into the Sparkfun Electronics
		competition in Niwot, Colorado. Our goal was to replace the remote control unit on a typical RC car with a series of sensors in order to make the 
		car move and detect obstacles while navigating a course autonomously. While this project was more an enthusiast endeavor as it wasn't for a company,
		it was still an invaluable source of practical experience in learning how to use C/C++ to interface with sensors and microcontrollers. 
	</p><br>
	<p><b>Role</b></p>
	<p>My role on the team was that of key concept holder, meaning I was in charge of planning and designing how the modules of the car would interact with
		one another. I also played a role in programming the various sensors of the car and implementing the algorithm for object detection and course navigation.
