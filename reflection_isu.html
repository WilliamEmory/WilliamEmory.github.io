	<p><b>Reflection</b></p>
	<p>My time at Iowa State has been some of the greatest four years of my life. When I began my college search I fell in love with 
		Iowa State's Software Engineering program.  Coding was something I was always interested in while I was in high school and Iowa State 
		gave me the tools and knowledge to turn that interest into a marketable skill. 
	</p>
	<p>Iowa State does a great job of teaching you the basics of code, but no university can teach all there is to know about a field that is 
		rapidly changing. As a result, one of the biggest perks of Iowa State is that it teaches one to teach oneself. While at Iowa State I've worked 
		on projects that required me to do mobile work, create databases, use SQL, research algorithms, or run queries on a Hadoop Server cluster, many 
		times with a few weeks or no prior knowledge of how to go about such a thing. I bonded with teachers and fellow students in my attempts to solve 
		these problems and finally reaching a solution always yielded a sense of satisfaction that reminded me why I chose to be a Software Engineer in 
		the first place. 
	</p>
	<p>I owe many of the internships I've worked to my success at Iowa State. The career fair combined with Iowa State's reputation have given me many 
		opportunities to code outside of the classroom. My internships at Hollander and Preventice have allowed me to work on developing largescale 
		applications that will potentially be used by thousands of clients. Iowa State taught me more than just how to code, it allowed me to learn how to 
		communicate and express ideas, taught me how to network, and taught me to be not just an engineer, but a well-rounded professional.  
	</p>
	<p>As I prepare to graduate from Iowa State, I will remember the years I spent here with both fondness and gratitude, as my education here has made taking 
	the jump into being a professional possible. Wherever I go and wherever I end up, I'm grateful for the role Iowa State had in getting me there.
