	<p><b>DiplomaCY Project</b></br>
		This was a project I worked on with Seth Rickard, Ian Abbott, and Jim Tappe. For a semester long project at Iowa State we decided to create an online interactive
		version of the board game Diplomacy, which is a strategy game similar in function to that of Risk. To create this project we used Java Servlets to interface with
		the front end logic and our server. I was responsible for the front end design of the game, using JSON to send game logic from the front end to the servlets, and
		helped my teammates write some of the servlets as well. This was my first major foray into front end development and helped solidify my skills in JavaScript, Jquery,
		using JSON objects, and writing servlets to create an interactive game that was playable by multiple people on different machines.

	<p><b>Tab Manager Project</b></br>
		This project invloved creating a tab manager in Chrome to manage and save tabs that were left open. It was designed for people who like to have ten or twenty or more
		tabs open, but don't want to close out anything for fear of needing it later. It was designed to collapse open tabs into a list that could be accessed via the plugin
		and provided a much cleaner UI experience. I worked on this project with Nick Plutt, Will Park, and Blane Cullen. We inherited this project from a group in a project
		management class as part of an excercise in simulating the experience of taking a pre-existing project over, versus starting one from scratch. I was the lead developer
		on the project and focused on adding new features and eliminating bugs from the previous groups efforts. This was a neat opportunity to work with creating plugins in
		Chrome, and provided me with the opportunity to further my experience with JavaScript and Jquery.

	<p><b>Embedded Systems Autonomous Robot Project</b><br>
		The culmination of a brief series of embedded systems classes I took at Iowa State resulted in the opportunity to program a robot through an obstacle course over the
		course of the semester. I worked with Seth Rickard and Ian Abbott to create a program that could effectively use IR, sonar, touch, and floor sensors to autonomously
		navigate through a series of obstacles and reach a designated point of the course. This project involved using C/C++ to create methods that could read and write to pins
		that the sensor was connected to as well as implement logic that would use sensor data to tell the robot where to go next. This was a nice change of pace from some of the
		other projects I had done, as it gave me a chance to work with C/C++ and do some lower level programming than what I had typically done before.
